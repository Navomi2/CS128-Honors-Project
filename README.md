Project Introduction: We are planning to implement a simple chat server/client. The final product should work on two separate machines.

Technical Overview:
- Checkpoint 1: Implementation of the client and server classes. Ensure they can communicate with one another in real time. This includes a server class that will access and handle client messages and a client class that will communicate with the server using a port number.
- Checkpoint 2: Extend program to run on two or more separate computers. Create simple graphics to run and test program.

Possible Challenges: 
- Utilizing relevant rust packages
- Generalizing the application to n number of computers (how to assign ports when there are multiple clients)
