Project Introduction: We are planning to implement a simple chat Server/ Client. The final product should work on two separate machines.

Technical Overview:
- Checkpoint 1: Implementation of the clinet and server classes. ensure they can communicate with one another in real time. This includes a server class that will access and handle client messages and a client class that will communicate with the server using a port number.
- Checkpoint 2: Extend program to run on two or more separate computers. Create simple graphics to run and test program.

Possible Challenges: 
- utilizing relevant rust packages
- generalizing the application to n number of computers (how to assign ports when there are multiple clients)
